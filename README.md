# AntiSpamPRLabeler

This GitHub Action automatically labels and comments on pull requests based on the number of changes. It's designed to help maintainers quickly identify potential spam or small contributions by automatically labeling pull requests as 'Potential Spam' if they contain a small number of changes and commenting for further review.

## Prerequisites

This action requires the `GITHUB_TOKEN` with permissions to fetch PRs and add labels and comments. The action uses this token to authenticate API requests, ensuring secure and permissioned interactions with your repository.

## Usage

To incorporate this action into your workflow, add the following step to your GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/antispam-pr-labeler.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Label and Comment PRs
  uses: PraiseXI/AntiSpamPRLabeler@v1
  with:
    repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    max-changes-for-label: '10' #default is 2
    label-message: 'This PR has been automatically labeled as "Potential Spam" due to its size. Please review.' 
    # Optional, default message provided
```
This snippet shows how to configure the action to use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for API requests and allows for optional parameters to customize the labeling and commenting behavior.
## Inputs

`repo-token`: **Required**. The GitHub token used to authenticate API requests. This should generally be set to **`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`** to utilize the automatic token GitHub provides.

`max-changes-for-label`: **Optional**. The maximum number of changes a PR can have before being labeled as 'Potential Spam'. Default is 2.

`label-message`: **Optional**. The message to comment on PRs that are labeled as 'Potential Spam'. A default message is provided if not set.

## Outputs
There are no outputs defined for this action. Its primary function is to label and comment on PRs directly.
